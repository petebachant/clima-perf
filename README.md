# CliMA performance

Tracking CliMA performance over time.

## TODO

1. Create a visualization showing SYPD and which packages have changed since
   the previous datapoint (more than the `changed` category for that day).
   Make it possible to click a link to see the diff of that version versus
   the last date the benchmark was run.
